# Download from 
https://github.com/daboynb/PlayIntegrityNEXT/releases/tag/Release

# Why this fork?
It downloads the fingerprint automatically.

# Instructions

1 Download PlayIntegrityFix_NEXT.zip (https://github.com/daboynb/PlayIntegrityNEXT/releases/download/Release/PlayIntegrityFix_NEXT.zip) and gms.apk (https://github.com/daboynb/PlayIntegrityNEXT/releases/download/Release/Gms.apk)

2 Flash the PlayIntegrityFix_NEXT.zip and reboot

3 Install the gms.apk and grant the necessary permissions, check if notifications are turned on or you won't be able to read them.
( if you are unable to install the apk use this (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aefyr.sai)  or this (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alloc64.apkinstaller) )

4 Use the SPIC app to verify Play integrity or the play store checker.

When the FP will be banned, you will only need to open the gms app and then check for Play Integrity Attestation, the module will download the new PIF.json on /data/adb/pif.json.

# ATTENTION
Sometimes, you may need to double-check for Play Integrity Attestation if the new PIF.json was just downloaded.
It can happen if you use apps like Yasnac. Currently, I have not encountered this bug using the Google Play developer check.
