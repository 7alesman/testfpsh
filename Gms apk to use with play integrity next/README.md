# Download from 
https://github.com/daboynb/PlayIntegrityNEXT/releases/tag/Release

# Why this fork?
It downloads the fingerprint automatically.

# Instructions

• Download Play Integrity Fix Next Module 

• Flash the PlayIntegrityFix_NEXT.zip and reboot

• Open the gms app and grant the necessary permissions, check if notifications are turned on or you won't be able to read them.

• Use the SPIC app to verify Play integrity or the play store checker.

When the FP will be banned, you will only need to open the gms app and then check for Play Integrity Attestation, the module will download the new PIF.json on /data/adb/pif.json.

If the fp_downloader is not working you can use :

    - Open Termux
    - Type "su"
    - Type "gms"

If you get the "syntax error" on termux or app use the Old legacy gms app [here](https://github.com/daboynb/PlayIntegrityNEXT/blob/main/Gms%20apk%20to%20use%20with%20play%20integrity%20next/Gms_legacy.apk)
