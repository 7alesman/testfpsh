# Download from 
https://github.com/daboynb/PlayIntegrityNEXT/releases/tag/Release

# Why this fork?
It downloads the fingerprint automatically.

# Instructions
1) Download the zip
2) Download the apk
3) Install the apk and grant root permissions ( if you are unable to install the apk use 
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aefyr.sai or https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alloc64.apkinstaller)
4) Flash the zip and reboot

When the FP will be banned, you will only need to open the app and then check for Play Integrity Attestation. The module will download the new PIF.json. 

# ATTENTION
Sometimes, you may need to double-check for Play Integrity Attestation if the new PIF.json was just downloaded.
It can happen if you use apps like Yasnac. Currently, I have not encountered this bug using the Google Play developer check.
