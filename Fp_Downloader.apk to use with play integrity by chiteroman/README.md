# Instructions

• Download playcurl.zip [HERE](https://github.com/daboynb/PlayIntegrityNEXT/releases/download/playcurl/playcurl.zip) and play integrity fix module (by chiteroman) [HERE](https://github.com/chiteroman/PlayIntegrityFix/releases/latest)

• Flash both modules and reboot

• Open the fp_downloader app and grant the necessary permissions, check if notifications are turned on or you won't be able to read them. 

• Use the SPIC app to verify Play integrity or the play store checker.

When the FP will be banned, you will only need to open the fp_downloader app or use the termux command "fp".
