# Instructions

1 Download playcurl.zip (https://github.com/daboynb/PlayIntegrityNEXT/releases/download/fp_downloader/playcurl.zip) and fp-downloader.apk (https://github.com/daboynb/PlayIntegrityNEXT/releases/download/fp_downloader/Fp_Downloader.apk) 

2 Download the chiteroman's module (https://github.com/chiteroman/PlayIntegrityFix/releases/latest)

3 Flash the playcurl and the chiteroman's module  > reboot.

4 Install fp_downloader.apk, launch the app and grant the necessary permissions.

5 Use the SPIC app to verify Play integrity or the play store checker.

When the FP will be banned, you will only need to open the fp_downloader app and then check for Play Integrity Attestation, the app will download the new PIF.json on /data/adb/pif.json.

- Install the apk and grant root permissions ( if you are unable to install the apk use 
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aefyr.sai or https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alloc64.apkinstaller)

- Enjoy, you'll have always the updated fp with the original module, if the fp gets banned you will only need to launch the apk
