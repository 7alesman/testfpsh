# Instructions

• Download playcurl.zip and play integrity fix module (by chiteroman)

• Flash both modules and reboot

• Open the fp_downloader app and grant the necessary permissions, check if notifications are turned on or you won't be able to read them. 

• Use the SPIC app to verify Play integrity or the play store checker.

When the FP will be banned, you will only need to open the fp_downloader app or use the termux command "fp".
