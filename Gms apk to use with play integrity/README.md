# Instructions

1) Download the zip
2) Download the apk
3) Flash the zip and reboot
4) Install the apk and grant root permissions ( if you are unable to install the apk use 
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aefyr.sai or https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alloc64.apkinstaller)
When the FP will be banned, you will only need to open the app and then check for Play Integrity Attestation. The module will download the new PIF.json.
