# Instructions

Follow this steps :

- Remove playintegrityfix next and reboot (if installed)

- Flash playcurl.zip and reboot

- Disable (NOT REMOVE) the playcurl module

- Flash the playintegrityfix by chiteroman v 14.6 (newest version are not working at the moment for some users) and reboot

- Go to /data/adb/playintegrityfix and delete pif.json (if present)

- Install the apk and grant root permissions ( if you are unable to install the apk use 
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aefyr.sai or https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alloc64.apkinstaller)

- Enjoy, you'll have always the updated fp with the original module, if the fp gets banned you will only need to launch the apk
