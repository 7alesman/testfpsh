# Instructions
Open the app and wait until it says "done", it will delete the old pif.json and download a new one.

It's a beta.

It downloads random fingerprints from https://github.com/TheFreeman193/PIFS. 

If you like the Russian roulette :)

# Requirements
Magisk, busybox and termux

# Issues 
Use with play integrity fix v14.6 only (not working with play integrity fix 14.8 and 14.9 for some users).
